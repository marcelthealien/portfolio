ZBRUSH

HOT KEYS
BST= standard brush
BCB= Clay build up
BDS= C Sub = carve (alt = inverse)
BTD = PLANES
BNV = big chunks of polygons
SHIFT = SMOOTH
Dynamic = how close to model --> dynamic on is consistent
resolution --> shift F (see wire frame) --> geometry--> divide --> hotkey cntrl D--> polycount x 4--> shift D to go back, D to dived and cntrl D to add another level
Dont divide up to 10 000 000
If you want to work on a certain part and divide only that part, use dynamesh.
dynamesh--> tool--> geom--> dynamesh
would you like to freeze? NO!
wrk with the res and scale hand in hand
BNV = MOVE
with dynamesh active, we can drag and hold cntrl to maintain res (dynamically) (view in poly frame (shift F))
cntrl SHIFT = trim
alt= inverse
SUBTOOL: append
cntrl W = mask all visible
Sutool for group split
mask = cntrl + paint
subtract mask = cntrl drag outside (as in dynamesh)
