<h1>Architecture for Art</h1>

<p>Marcel's journey in art bagan when he met Artist and Industrial Designer, Charles Haupt, at the Heavy Metal exhibition at the Woodstock Foundry (CT) in 2013.

He decided to study Architecture at UCT after considering Industrial Design and Art.
During his studies he job-shadowed Sculptor Otto du Plessis, and taking a fancy to the work of Bronze Age Studio he split his 3rd year over two years to work for Bronze Age Studio part-time.

During his 4th year at university he attended a Summer Studio program at the Bartlett School of Architecture in London where he gained insight to the marriage of art and architecture.  

Completing his undergraduate in 2017, he worked for Architect Peter Neokrides and later for the film industry in Cape Town as a draftsman and set designer.

His experiences in the fields of architecture and design have enriched and fueled his ceaseless passion for visual art.

After a year abroad in South America he has returned to Bronze Age, somewhat as a prodigal son, and enjoys working for the studio and learning a lot as an apprentice.

Today, in art, he is interested in sculpture, print-making and architectural fictions. 
He loves and draws inspiration from the works of Iakov Chernikov and MC Escher.
